## Usage

There are 2 methods to install the template for your project:
1. Install cookicutter and run `cookiecutter gh:dbranco/frontend-template`
2. Or, using docker like [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dbranco/cookiecutter-fet)

In both cases, it will be asked for inputs in order to create a frontend project in react with all minimal you need.
